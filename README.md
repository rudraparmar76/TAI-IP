Welcome to the repository for my exciting internship at Tech-A-Intern! 🚀 Throughout this internship, I had the fantastic opportunity to dive headfirst into the world of web development and design.

## 2. Carousel 🌅🎠

The dynamic image carousel project was an exhilarating challenge where I brought interactivity to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This endeavor honed my JavaScript skills and provided valuable insights into creating interactive components.
