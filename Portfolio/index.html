                        I'm Rudra Parmar, currently pursuing a diploma in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) at
                        Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic, Mumbai. In my second year, I'm passionate about exploring
                        technology and programming.

                        Throughout my education, I've built a strong foundation in programming languages and web
                        development, excelling in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating interactive web pages. I've
                        also ventured into back-end programming with Java and PHP, enabling me to develop dynamic
                        websites.

                        Beyond academics, I actively seek certifications to broaden my skills and become a versatile
                        tech professional. Continuous learning and staying updated are crucial for my personal and
                        professional growth, making me eager to embrace new challenges and emerging technologies.

                        During my free time, I engage in personal coding projects and collaborative problem-solving,
                        finding fulfillment in bringing my code to life and making a positive impact.

                        As I progress, I aim to contribute to the tech community and participate in meaningful projects
                        that drive innovation. Excited about my future, I look forward to learning, growing, and leaving
                        a mark in the world of technology.
                    </p>
